Learn about the impact of Dana-Farber on our patients and the communities we serve."}],decades:[{decade:"1940s",summary:"The Pioneering Years: How Sidney Farber Became the “Father of Chemotherapy”",description:"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute was founded in 1947 as the Children's Cancer Research Foundation by Dr. Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Boston Children's Hospital. In 1948, Farber treated his first patient with aminopterin, a drug that induced remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His success garnered attention leading to further funding. Backed by influential donors and the national radio exposure of his young patient “Jimmy” from which emerged the Jimmy Fund, our journey had begun."},{decade:"1950s",summary:"Advancing Cancer Care: Dana-Farber's Major Breakthroughs in the 1950s",description:"In the 1950s, Dana-Farber researchers continued to make strides in cancer treatment. In 1954, Farber and his team developed methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug that is still used to treat a variety of cancers today. In 1959, Dana-Farber researchers discovered the first genetic abnormality associated with cancer. The jimmy fund continued to grow, becoming the exclusive charity of the Boston Red Sox.  "},{decade:"1960s",summary:"Decoding Cancer: How Dana-Farber's Research in the 1960s Changed the Game",description:"The 1960s were an exciting time of progress in cancer research and the growth of the Institute. Dana-Farber’s researchers focused on understanding the genetic basis of cancer. They performed the first bone marrow transplant in a human patient, and radiation therapy became a common treatment. In 1963, the Farber Center was renamed the Sidney Farber Cancer Center of Harvard University, and it became affiliated with Harvard Medical School."},{decade:"1970s",summary:"Targeted Therapies and Dramatic Improvements in Patient Outcomes",description:"Equipped with a growing staff of enthusiastic and committed researchers, Dana-Farber accelerated the pace of discovery and unleashed significant progress in the development of targeted therapies. In 1971, researchers discovered the first oncogene, a gene that can cause cancer when mutated. In 1976, they discovered the first tumor suppressor gene, a gene that helps to prevent cancer by regulating cell growth. Emil “Tom” Frei became the Institute’s director after the death of Sidney Farber in 1973 and his groundbreaking work in combination chemotherapy radically improved patient survival rates. In 1974, the Farber Center was renamed the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in recognition of William and Blanche Dana's significant philanthropic contributions to the Center."},{decade:"1980s",summary:"Acceleration in Cancer Genetics Discoveries",description:"The influence of Dana-Farber continued to rapidly expand in the 1980s during this exciting decade of discovery. Then president, Baruj Benacceraf, MD, received a Nobel Prize in 1980 for discoveries in the genetic underpinnings of the human immune system. The first monoclonal antibody for cancer treatments were developed in 1985 and 1989, Dana-Farber researchers discovered the first genetic mutations associated with inherited forms of cancer, including the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which are linked to breast and ovarian cancer. By the 1980s, two out of every three children who enter the Jimmy Fund Clinic became cancer-free. The Sidney Farber Cancer Institute was renamed Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in recognition of generous support from the Charles A. Dana Foundation and the Pan Mass Challenge is launched by Billy Starr in 1980? with all proceeds to support the Jimmy Fund."},{decade:"1990s",summary:"Acceleration in Cancer Genetics Discoveries",description:"The 1990s were a decade of groundbreaking discoveries in cancer research at Dana-Farber. In 1996, researchers developed the first molecularly targeted therapy drug, Gleevec, which revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. In 1997, they discovered the first gene associated with inherited forms of colon cancer, a finding that led to new screening and prevention strategies for this disease. Dana-Farber establishes the nation's first Adult Patient and Family Advisory Council which becomes a model for other centers to involve patients and their families in developing the highest standard of comprehensive and compassionate health care."},{decade:"2000s",summary:"Personalized Medicine and Collaborative Research",description:"In the 2000s, Dana-Farber continued to expand with Ed Benz, Jr., MD assuming leadership of the Institute in 2000. Dana-Farber researchers were at the forefront of genomics and personalized medicine. In 2003, Dana-Farber played a key role in the Human Genome Project, which mapped the entire human genome. This led to the identification of new genetic mutations associated with cancer, and the development of targeted therapies that are tailored to the individual patient. In 2008, Dana-Farber researchers developed the first targeted therapy drug for melanoma, a type of skin cancer that had previously been difficult to treat."},{decade:"2010s",summary:"The Power of Immunotherapy",description:"The 2010s saw the emergence of immunotherapy as a major breakthrough in cancer treatment. This approach harnesses the power of the immune system to fight cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy are two examples of immunotherapy that have shown great promise in treating a variety of cancers. These treatments have revolutionized cancer care, leading to long-term remissions in some patients. Dana-Farber continues its expansion with the opening of the 275,000 square foot Yawkey Center for Cancer Care in 2011 and makes advances in patient care with the development of patient navigation. Laurie H. Glimcher, MD becomes the first woman president of the Institute in 2016."},{decade:"2020s",summary:"The Quest for Health Equity",description:"In the 2020s, Dana-Farber researchers continued to innovate in cancer research and treatment despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. They developed new treatments for blood cancers and solid tumors, including a novel drug that targets a genetic mutation found in many types of cancer. Dana-Farber also embarks on a major initiative to improve cancer care for underserved populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and people living in rural areas. The Pan-Mass Challenge reaches $900 million in cumulative fundraising for the Jimmy Fund, paving the way $1 billion in 2024."}]},W={title:"Pages / Home",parameters:{layout:"fullscreen"},args:H,render(e,a){var s,c,d,h,m,l,u,p;return o`
